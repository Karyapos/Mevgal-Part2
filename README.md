# Mevgal-Part2: Scenarios

## **‚öôÔ∏è Skills Used**

- **SQL**: Querying, filtering, and preparing datasets (**focus**)
- **Power BI**: Basic dashboard creation and metrics visualization
- **Realistic Scenario Modeling**: Built a complex simulation from real sales data using custom logistics, returns, and cost rules to reflect real-world challenges (**focus**)

## üß© **Scenario Overview**

This section simulates four strategic business paths based on the **original sales data** of **7 dairy products (Mevgal Project Part 1)**. Each scenario highlights a different approach in response to operational and market challenges.

### üìà **Scenario 1 ‚Äì Advertisement Investment (3 Years)**

We assume a **one-time investment** in a strong advertisement campaign:

- **Estimated cost**: ~1.2 million
- **Sales impact**:
    - +20% in Year 1
    - +15% in Year 2
    - +10% in Year 3
- **Assumption**: No change in product quality, production, or logistics
- **Result**: Increased visibility leads to steady sales growth, supporting long-term income increase

### üßæ **Scenario 2 ‚Äì Merchant Deal (1 Year)**

A **deal with 5 major merchants** (1 per city) to offload all surplus units:

- **Sales method**: Merchants buy all extra stock at a **modest price ~0.50 above production cost** (range: 0.36‚Äì0.51)
- **Distribution**: **No new logistics needed** ‚Äì uses only **spare truck space from regular orders**
- **Market effect**: Our public sales decrease by **10%**, as merchants cover part of the market
- **Investment**: None
- **Result**: Small revenue boost from unused capacity, but reduced overall market presence

---

### üß™ **Scenario 3 ‚Äì Production Shift & Quality Drop (3 Years)**

A more **aggressive restructuring** of internal operations:

- **Step 1**: Rent out the **Unit B production department**  for **1.5M/year**
- **Step 2**: Modify **Unit A** to handle all production with lower costs via **general quality reduction**
- **Upgrade cost**: 1M (one-time investment)
- **Sales impact** due to reduced quality:
    - 5% in Year 1
    - 10% in Year 2
    - 15% in Year 3
- **Result**: Profitable from Year 2 due to rental income, but gradually diminishing sales due to consumer dissatisfaction with product quality

---

### üöö **Scenario 4 ‚Äì Logistics Upgrade (1 Year)**

A **logistics investment** solves delivery constraints:

- **Investment**: 1.4 million for a **new fleet of advanced trucks**
- **New truck features**:
    - Capacity: 500 units (vs 100)
    - **Multi-temperature capability**: All products can now be **combined in a single trip**
- **Updated trip costs per station**:
    - 110 / 130 / 145 / 110 / 175
- **Result**: Huge efficiency boost‚Äîfewer rides, higher capacity per trip, and flexibility in routing


## üìå **Note on Data Authenticity**

While the sales data in this project is **100% real**, all other elements‚Äîcosts, logistics constraints, and scenario assumptions‚Äîwere **entirely fictional and created by me**. The aim was to simulate realistic business decisions and outcomes based on actual operational conditions.

The Power BI visuals intentionally **exclude the initial investment amounts** required in each scenario to maintain a clear focus on the impact of operational strategies (sales, costs, and profits) over time. These investments are discussed in the scenario descriptions, not visualized in the charts.

This fictional approach reflects my ability to **design data-driven, business-relevant scenarios** that closely mirror **real-world strategic thinking and numerical modeling**.

## üß© **Conclusion**

This second part of the Mevgal project pushed me to think beyond analysis and take on the mindset of a decision-maker. By creating realistic business scenarios grounded in logic, market dynamics, and operational constraints, I strengthened my understanding of strategic planning and scenario modeling.

Through this process, I gained practical experience in:

- Translating business ideas into measurable data outcomes
- Structuring scenario logic with numerical precision
- Leveraging SQL, Excel, and Power BI to simulate the impact of decisions

Most importantly, this project made me realize that **none of my past experience was wasted**. My time in logistics, warehousing, and transportation became a solid foundation‚Äîenabling me to turn raw data into insights that reflect real-world operations. This connection between the field and data is a core strength I bring as an aspiring analyst in supply chain and logistics.
